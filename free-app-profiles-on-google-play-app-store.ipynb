Next in our analysis will be to determine which tpyes of apps have the most users.\n\n## Most Popular Apps by Genre\n\nThe easiest way to determine popularity of an app is to calculate the average number of installs per category. We can use the ```Installs``` column for the Google Play data but unfortunately iOS does not have a similar column. We can use the number of user ratings as a proxy. This number can be found in the ```rating_count_tot``` column.\n\nBelow I'll calculate the average number of user ratings / installs per app on the App Store:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ios_genres = freq_table(ios_final, 11)\n\nfor genre in ios_genres:\n    total = 0\n    len_genre = 0\n    \n    for app in ios_final:\n        genre_app = app[11]\n        if genre_app == genre:\n            total += float(app[5])\n            len_genre += 1\n    avg_rating = total / len_genre\n    print(genre, ':', avg_rating)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T01:53:15.970189Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T01:53:15.970779Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.008124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T01:53:15.970743Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.006998Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Navigation has the highest number of reviews, but that figure is being skewed by a few large apps like Google Maps and Waze:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for app in ios_final:\n    if app[11] == 'Navigation':\n        print(app[1], ':', app[5])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.009760Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.010097Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.018441Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.010058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T01:53:16.017854Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our goal is to find popular app genres but some of these apps may seem more poular than they are.
